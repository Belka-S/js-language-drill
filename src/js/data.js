00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,460
Hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish!

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,120
We're coming up to that time of year again when there

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,980
are lots of events and celebrations

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,880
that means lots of mingling, lots of chatting to people

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,840
that you don't know and making small talk.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,520
It happens at work,

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,880
at gatherings with friends or friends of friends and

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,300
families of friends,

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,100
neighbours, even people that you bump into in the lift.

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,840
We've got to practise these skills.

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,380
With small talk, we can build rapport

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,980
with our colleagues, make new friends

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,340
and just generally feel more positive

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,560
about the interactions that we have with other people.

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,220
So today I'm going to take you through thirty questions

16
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,520
to make small talk, to build to the confidence

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,160
to start conversations in English.

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,120
But before I do, I want to give a quick shout out

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,320
to Lingoda who are sponsoring today's lesson.

20
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,640
If you want to overcome your fear of speaking

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,280
and you want to do it quickly, then you need

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,360
to hear about the new three month challenges:

23
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,820
the Sprint and the Super Sprint.

24
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,680
Both of these new promotions help you to commit

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,440
and take massive action to level up your language skills

26
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,670
in just three months.

27
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,960
And both give you the chance to get a refund

28
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,260
on the fees that you pay for your classes.

29
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,560
So what's the difference between the Sprint

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,080
and the Super Sprint?

31
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,080
The Sprint challenges you to take

32
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,280
fifteen classes a month for three months in a row.

33
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,920
Complete that and you get fifty per cent refund

34
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,140
on your course fees.

35
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,420
The Super Sprint challenges you to take

36
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,820
thirty classes per month for three months.

37
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,070
Complete that

38
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,960
and you'll get a hundred percent refund

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,660
on your tuition fees, it's that simple.

40
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,740
I took the Lingoda Marathon and it was

41
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,640
one of the best things that I've ever done.

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,340
I practise my Spanish every day with native teachers

43
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,740
and I earned real certifications.

44
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,000
Lingoda is a quality language school which is of course

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,040
why I recommend them to you.

46
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,720
With small group classes available 24/7,

47
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,760
the flexibility is a huge plus.

48
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,980
The next Sprints are happening from January to April.

49
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,620
What a way to start the new year,

50
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,680
especially if you end up getting that refund right?

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,620
So if you think you've got what it takes,

52
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,760
secure your place by signing up

53
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,340
by December 19. You need to pay 49 euros as a deposit

54
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,140
and if you use this code,

55
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,360
you'll get 10 euros off that deposit.

56
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,120
All the rules and event details

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,540
are on the Lingoda website and of course,

58
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,980
I'll put the link to that in the description below.

59
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,940
Small talk is an incredibly important function of English

60
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,440
conversation. It's about comfort,

61
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,300
it's about helping two people: you and

62
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,480
the other person that you're talking to,

63
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,580
to feel comfortable with each other.

64
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,900
And the intention is to try and find some common

65
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,880
interests, something that you can share together.

66
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,120
So I want you to think of yourself as a detective.

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,500
You're searching for some information and some clues

68
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,720
to help you connect with someone, to find

69
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,180
some common ground and some shared interests.

70
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,740
A good way to approach small talk is to focus on a few

71
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,300
broad categories:

72
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,740
work,

73
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,700
life,

74
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,260
travel,

75
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,620
food,

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,120
and the weather.

77
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,200
Now I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that

78
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,100
about ninety per cent of all small talk conversations

79
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,260
focus on these topics. Maybe even ninety five.

80
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,880
But this is great because it allows us to focus on

81
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,880
some really specific topics, right?

82
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,820
And help you to prepare for conversations

83
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,820
that you're very likely to actually experience.

84
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,980
There's another thing that's useful to keep in mind

85
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,180
with small talk and that's time.

86
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,460
With all of these topics, we can ask questions

87
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,540
that relate to the current situation now,

88
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,240
any experience in the past or any future dreams

89
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,840
or future plans, right?

90
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,220
So pay close attention to the examples

91
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,000
that I'm going to share because I'll be using

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,120
some different time references in these questions.

93
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,520
So let's get started with thirty questions

94
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,520
to help you master small talk conversations.

95
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,780
Starting with work. Now the most common question

96
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,120
here is "What do you do?"

97
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,100
So we're talking about now.

98
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,800
What's their current job?

99
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,300
Imagine that the person that you're talking to

100
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,500
said they're a nurse but we want to ask some more

101
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,620
detail, right? We want to find out how we can

102
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,260
continue the conversation.

103
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,340
So let's go back in time.

104
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,280
What motivated you to become a nurse?

105
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,800
Did you always want to be a nurse?

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,780
What was your first-ever job? Did you like it?

107
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,020
We can talk about the present as well.

108
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,900
What does your typical work day look like?

109
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,220
What do you love about your job?

110
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,500
And you can get a little creative with some future

111
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,420
questions as well.

112
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,740
So is this your dream job

113
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,740
or are you working towards something else?

114
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,880
You want to be careful here that you don't say

115
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,820
"working towards something bigger"

116
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,040
or "something better"

117
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,680
because it might be a little offensive, right?

118
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,160
You're sort of saying that their job

119
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,400
that they currently have isn't good enough.

120
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,460
If money wasn't an issue, what job would you want?

121
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,160
Some people might say that they don't want to work

122
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,620
if they didn't have any issues with money, right?

123
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,820
But you might have to rephrase that question and say

124
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,300
"Well what would you do?"

125
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,040
or "How would you spend your time?"

126
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,720
Another really great small talk topic

127
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,960
is just talking about life

128
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,740
and there's a couple of ways that you can do this.

129
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,420
You can pay attention to local news headlines,

130
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,620
this is a really good way of, you know,

131
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,520
finding things to talk about.

132
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,600
Did you hear about

133
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,920
the accident on the freeway last night?

134
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,040
It sounded awful, I got stuck in traffic for over two hours

135
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,740
Albeit you might end up talking a lot about

136
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,740
all of the negative stuff that we see in the news, right?

137
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,640
But you can also ask questions about what's happening

138
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,960
in a person's life.

139
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,880
So remember that your intention is to try and find some

140
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,280
common interests right? Some things

141
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,020
that you share, so that you can

142
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,260
keep talking about those things together.

143
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,160
Have you got much planned for the weekend?

144
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,760
This is a great question, it's my go-to.

145
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,460
Everyone loves talking about their plans on the weekend

146
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,640
What do you like to do in your spare time?

147
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,760
Now if they share something that you also like,

148
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,980
that's great because you can keep talking about

149
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,200
your shared interest

150
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,180
or if they share something that you don't know anything

151
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,380
about, ask them for more information.

152
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,580
That's so interesting!

153
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,740
I've never met anyone who keeps bees

154
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,400
and makes their own honey.

155
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,560
How much honey do you get each week?

156
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,460
Have you ever been bitten by a bee?

157
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,220
Is it easy to keep bees

158
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,940
or do you have to be an expert?

159
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,080
Have you read any good books lately?

160
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Have you seen any good movies?

161
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,720
If you're a mum or you're a dad, you might even ask

162
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,240
"So do you have any kids?"

163
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,200
because this is a great way to connect with someone.

164
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,740
You talk about your kid's

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,580
ages, interests maybe even their naughty habits.

166
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,620
Same thing with pets actually.

167
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,700
Have you noticed that I've been using 'so' quite a bit

168
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,680
to introduce a new idea to a conversation.

169
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,080
This is really quite a natural way to introduce a new

170
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,940
question. One that's unrelated to what you've been

171
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,760
talking about previously.

172
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,480
It's a really helpful conversation tool.

173
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,700
So are you from here?

174
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,800
This is a great question to help explore someone's

175
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,900
past, go back in time.

176
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,140
Where did you live before this?

177
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,040
Is this city quite different to that city?

178
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,440
Where did you grow up?

179
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,300
Travel is a great small talk topic. It's something

180
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,160
that we love talking about and we love sharing.

181
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,280
So we can talk about our past experience

182
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,460
or we can talk about travel plans and dreams

183
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,280
for the future, right?

184
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,920
If you're coming up to a holiday season

185
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,360
you're heading into summer,

186
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,360
then a great conversation starter is

187
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,960
"So are you planning on getting away for the holidays?"

188
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,260
Are you taking time off over Christmas?

189
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,460
Or whatever holiday is coming up.

190
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,120
But if it's not that time of year, you can easily

191
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,820
start a conversation by introducing some context, right?

192
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,520
By sharing your experience first

193
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,540
and then inviting their input.

194
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,200
So I've just got back from a trip to Japan.

195
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,320
Have you ever been?

196
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,560
Or maybe you might know something about

197
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,340
their experience.

198
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,300
You went to Peru last year, didn't you?

199
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,500
I'm planning on taking my fiancee to South America

200
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,540
in June. It's our first time

201
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,580
and I'm not really sure

202
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,200
which countries we're going to visit.

203
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,180
Do you have any recommendations?

204
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,300
Do you have any recommendations about which

205
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,580
country to visit in South America?

206
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,540
I am thinking about a trip next year.

207
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,800
I love travelling.

208
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,100
I hope to visit Kerala in the south of India

209
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,860
at some point soon.

210
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,780
What places are on your bucket list?

211
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,160
I'm actually really keen to hear your answers

212
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,660
to this question. What places are on your bucket list?

213
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,680
What places are you dreaming about visiting?

214
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,060
Make sure you let me know in the comments.

215
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,740
Just like travel, food is another great small talk topic.

216
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,080
It's something that we all have in common.

217
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,700
We do it at least three times a day,

218
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,380
so there are plenty of opportunities

219
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,780
to start a conversation about food.

220
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,900
I'm trying to decide where to go for lunch,

221
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,160
do you know any good restaurants around here?

222
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,620
I'm cooking lasagna for dinner tonight.

223
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,100
What about you?

224
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,780
Hey have you tried that new Thai restaurant

225
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,680
on Church Street? I've heard it's amazing.

226
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,600
Do you like Thai food?

227
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,480
Now I just can't leave weather off the list.

228
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,760
This is the absolute number one small talk topic.

229
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,340
It can be used as a simple passing comment, right?

230
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
It's a beautiful day today, isn't it?

231
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,760
Can you believe all the rain we've been having lately?

232
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,720
But you can also use the weather as a way to spark

233
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,480
a conversation, by using it to introduce

234
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,240
another topic or another activity.

235
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,680
It's pouring out there! It's a shame I rode my bike today.

236
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,060
How did you get to work?

237
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,580
So there you have it! Thirty different questions, thirty

238
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,520
ways to start a conversation with small talk  in English.

239
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,680
Now I'm going to set a little homework for you,

240
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,530
a little challenge, okay?

241
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,680
Because memorising and practising the questions

242
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,000
that I've shared with you today is one thing,

243
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
that's great practice but of course,

244
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,480
what you need is to be ready to answer

245
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,720
those questions as well

246
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,180
so that you can keep the conversation going.

247
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,020
So your homework is to think of your own answers

248
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,300
to these questions too. Once you ask them

249
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,720
and then you hear the answer, you want to be ready

250
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,520
with your own experiences and your own opinions

251
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,680
to share, right? To keep the small talk going.

252
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,500
If you'd like me to make some conversation workouts

253
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,320
about each of these topics just like this one,

254
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,080
then make sure you tell me in the comments,

255
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,820
that way we can practise asking questions

256
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,500
and responding to them out loud together.

257
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,340
We're going to focus on tone and pronunciation

258
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,340
to help them come out really naturally.

259
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,720
And don't forget to check out Lingoda,

260
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,700

261
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,340

then come and check it out, this is where I share

266
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,420
a little bit of personal stuff about my life

267
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,320
and about the amazing people that are in it.

268
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,080
If you're ready to keep practising with me now,

269
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,440
then come and check out these lessons here.

270
